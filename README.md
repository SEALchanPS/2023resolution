# 2023 Resolution

And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream.

And the player began a new dream.

And the player dreamed again, dreamed better.

And the player was the universe. And the player was love.

You’re the player.

Wake up.

# Introduction of the Repository

2023 is a new year, when everyone should have more ambitious dreams, more inspiring goals, and stronger beliefs.

As the new year approaches, sc (of course, I) have made a New Year's resolution on GitHub to be a better self in the new year. This is a repository to track my steps towards my resolution, or my DREAM in my new year.

**Note: The resolutions listed in this README are only approximate targets. To see the specific plan, or to check progress, go to the subfolder of this repo.**

# My Resolution

## About Study or Learning

### in Mathematics: achieve the ability to understand IMO questions (and even solve them)

Finish learning high-school mathematics until March end (if possible), then practice for Gaokao until summer vacation. Begin (maybe Finish?) to learn Advanced Mathematics in the last half of the year. 

Whenever I finish learning a small point, I will go to previous years' maths competition tests to find a topic that I can solve, and in the process I will be constantly working on my maths problem solving skills.

### in Other Science Subjects: reach the level to pass the Gaokao papers

Finish learning other Science Subject as well as practice to achieve the ability to pass the Gaokao papers (get at least 60% Correct Rate in each subject).

If I come across knowledge that interests me, I can try to expand on them as much as possible without affecting the overall plan; conversely, I can also adjust the overall plan.

### in Other Liberal Arts: achieved the ability to pass the Conformity Test

Since I’m not interested in most of the Liberal Arts, my goal about them this year is to simply pass the Conformity Test.

### in Language: try best to improve writing

Write some articles or poems, read more books, in order to improve my writing skills.

This section will be completed when the plan starts to be implemented in detail.

### in English: reach the vocabulary of 10,000 words

Read the docs of development tools in English and search about as well as take notes about the unknowing words to improve vocabulary. Then practice some writing skills to cope with “Story Completion”.

## About My Hobbies

### in Programming: learn more about Python and learn C++

Since I am still not very proficient in Python, I will continue to read Python related books and do some Python related development areas to improve my Python skills. At the same time, I will start learning C++ and acquire the ability as Python.

My goal is to reach 100 followers on GitHub and about 100 stars on my projects.

### in Music Game: reach a RKS of 16.00 and a PTT of 12.00

This year I might make improving my music game a serious task. Because I am very lacking in multi-finger chart skills, so I need to practice more multi-finger charts in game in order to get a higher rating in music games.

### in Video/Photo Making: learn about PR, AE, PS, Blender and other software

This year I want to gain more followers by creating more videos. So I need to learn video making techniques and software hard. I want to learn how to use PR, AE, PS, Blender, etc. and put these skills into practice.

Then, I will create videos and publish them on bilibili, YouTube, etc. My goal is to reach 5,000 followers in total on all platforms.

### in Art: learn more about painting and drawing

After buying a digital tablet, I wanted to start learning simple drawing. By the end of this year I want to be able to create simple pieces of drawing.

### in Music Making: learn about FL Studio

At the same time I would like to learn some musical art like remixing. Since I don't know much about it, this part will be added after I officially start learning.

### in UI Design: learn about Figma and other software

Since I will be designing GUI software, I need to learn some UI design to complement my programming skills in order to create better software. Whenever I learn something, I will put it into practice.

## My Dream

### What do I want to be?

I want to be a better me. Some detailed goals are below.

1. Physical indicators: Height: 186cm -> 194cm, Weight: 72kg -> 65kg, BMI: 20.8 -> 17.8

2. Spirituality: I want to be more confident and have a more positive attitude towards life. I want to be able to talk freely with others in areas I am familiar with, and to be open-minded in areas I am not.

3. Social indicators: I would like to gain more friends on both QQ and Telegram. After some time, I need to have my own studio logo and name, and set up dedicated accounts on different platforms. I need to separate my work and personal accounts and remove some people I don't want to communicate with.

### What do I want to have?

1. Digital Tablet. Specific models are not yet determined.
2. Android Phone. Specific models are not yet determined.
3. Ohter things. Specific models are not yet determined.
